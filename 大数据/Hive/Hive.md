# Apache Hive (TM)
The Apache Hive (TM) data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. Built on top of Apache Hadoop (TM), it provides:  
* Tools to enable easy access to data via SQL, thus enabling data warehousing tasks such as extract/transform/load (ETL), reporting, and data analysis
* A mechanism to impose structure on a variety of data formats
* Access to files stored either directly in Apache HDFS (TM) or in other data storage systems such as Apache HBase (TM)
* Query execution using Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Tez or Apache Spark frameworks
