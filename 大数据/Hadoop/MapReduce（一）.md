# MapReduce
## Overview
Hadoop MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.  

A MapReduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the **map tasks** in a completely parallel manner.  
The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the **reduce tasks**.  
Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system.  
The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.

Typically the compute nodes and the storage nodes are the same, that is, the MapReduce framework and the Hadoop Distributed File System are running on the same set of nodes.  
This configuration allows the framework to effectively schedule tasks on the nodes where data is already present, resulting in very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.

The MapReduce framework consists of a single master **ResourceManager**, one slave **NodeManager** per cluster-node, and **MRAppMaster** per application.

Minimally, applications specify the input/output locations and supply map and reduce functions via implementations of appropriate interfaces and/or abstract-classes.  
These, and other job parameters, comprise the job configuration.

The Hadoop job client then submits the job and configuration to the ResourceManager which then assumes the responsibility of distributing the software/configuration to the slaves, scheduling tasks and monitoring them, providing status and diagnostic information to the job-client.

## Inputs and Outputs
The MapReduce framework operates exclusively on <key, value> pairs, that is, the framework views the input to the job as a set of <key, value> pairs and produces a set of <key, value> pairs as the output of the job, conceivably of different types.

The key and value classes have to be serializable by the framework and hence need to implement the Writable interface.
Additionally, the key classes have to implement the WritableComparable interface to facilitate sorting by the framework.
